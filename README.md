## Todo App

The way this Todo app works is simple. Type in a task or item  into the input field and press ADD ME (or hit Enter). Once you've submitted your item, your item will get added to MongoDB and you will see it appear as an entry in Todo App. You can keep adding item to add additional entries, they will get into MongoDb and have them all show up.To remove an item, just click on an existing entry. That entry will be removed from MongoDB as well as from the Todo App.
